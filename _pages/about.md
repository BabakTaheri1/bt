I am a research scientist at Hitachi Energy Research. I received my PhD in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Daniel Molzahn.

My passion lies in harnessing the power of mathematical optimization and machine learning techniques to foster a more reliable, resilient, affordable, and sustainable energy future. Outside of my work in research, I enjoy traveling, hiking, watching movies, and playing soccer and volleyball.
